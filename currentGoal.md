Create a method that unifies game logic performed on click
  this will be an instance method that checks game status
  alters card css
  flips card

Create shuffle method that can be called on the return value of ##createDeck in Layout.js  

I need to implement logic that alters background of card to either save the image to the instance, or... (when i create the instance, I can assign an instance variable the img url. When I later write click logic, I can just reset/add to a class that has the image, i.e: #joker ) Use of classList maybe
